# Cifar-10-Object-recognition-model

We used a convolutional neural network to categorise photos into 10 categories in this article. The network was trained using the CIFAR-10 dataset as a baseline. For updating weights, the Adam optimization method provides the most accurate picture categorization. I would need to work more on the Neural Networks as after running epochs 100 times, my accuracy was still 21%. And maybe by hyper tuning the parameters more often might increase the accuracy. Whereas in CNN, The accuracy touched 41%, which is more than fair. Now, working on Cifar-10, we can jump to Cifar-100 and deal with bigger data-sets to increase our expertise.
